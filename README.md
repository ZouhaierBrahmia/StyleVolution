# StyleVolution
StyleVolution is a suite of ready-to-use XQuery procedures for effective management of XML schema design style conversions. Our proposal considers the “Garden of Eden” design style as a normalized style and provides a kit of seven translation procedures: four procedures for translating any valid XML schema, whatever its design style, to such a normalized style, and three for translating a “Garden of Eden” XML schema to any one of the three other defined design styles. Any design style transformation could then be performed through the use of one procedure (if the source or target style is the “Garden of Eden”) or via the composition of two of the proposed procedures, passing through the generation of a schema with the “Garden of Eden” style as an intermediate result.
